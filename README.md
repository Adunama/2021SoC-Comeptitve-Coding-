# 2021SoC-Comeptitve-Coding-
I have covered all the topics being taught in the weekly sessions, and have learnt the basics of following topics:
1) Divide and Conquer : Solving a break by breaking it into multiple parts(mostly 2), and then solving them and then merging the results.
2) Dynamic Programming : Using memoisation to efficiently solve recursion of type F(n)=f(F(n-1)).
3) Sorting and Searching : Using binary search on sorted lists to improve efficiency of a program/
4) Graphs : DFS, BFS, basics on trees.
Usernames on Codeforces and CSES, where I have solved the assignment problems:
Codeforces: Adunama
